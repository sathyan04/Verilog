# Transistor Level Circuits
- In this repository, I have created the CMOS Transistor Logic based circuit design and tried to implement the basic gates using Switch - Level modeling.
- Each folder contain: 
  - A design file
  - A test-bench file
  - Waveform simulation

## Tools Used
- Icarus Verilog
- GTK Wave
